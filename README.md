# Transfer-Learning-Detect-Pneumonia

This is the transfer learning approach of detecting Pneumonia using Chest X-Ray Images. In the transfer learning approach, pre-built CNN like VGG16 will be used instead of re-training a new CNN. The purpose of this approach is to 1) compare how a pre-built CNN will perform compare to my previous built CNN 2) Just want to practice transfer learning.

This notebook will not include EDA, since it's already done from previous notebook. For the initial approach of detecting Pneumonia using Chest X-Ray images, please refer to https://github.com/jatlukze/Thinkful_Projects/blob/master/Final/Thinkful_Final_Capstone_Project_Detect_Pneumonia_using_Chest_X_Ray_Images.ipynb
